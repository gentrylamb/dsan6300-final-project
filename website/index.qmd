## Overview

This project analyzes U.S. airline performance data using SQL generated datasets covering delays, cancellations, airports, airlines, and temporal patterns.
The goals of the project are to:

- Understand patterns in flight volume and delays across airlines and airports
- Identify worst-performing airports for each airline
- Explore temporal trends such as busiest days and moving averages
- Build clear visual explanations combining multiple datasets

All analysis is performed in Python, documented through a Quarto website, with a narrative story to demonstrate findings and insights.
